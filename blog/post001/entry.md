# Yanks Air Museum

On September 22, 2018, many museums across the United States offered free admission through a partnership with Smithsonian Magazine. Yanks Air Museum was a participating location and appealed to my interest in historical aircraft.  

## About The Museum

Yanks is located in Chino, a half-hour's drive from where I currently attend college. Established in 1973, the museum focuses on preserving and restoring American aircraft. Yanks is one of two museums located on the grounds of Chino Airport, the other being the Planes of Fame Air Museum.  

### Legends Hangar

This hangar is home to numerous civilian aircraft which took to the skies between the Wright Brothers' first flight and World War II. A small number of World War II aircraft also reside in this building. 

The P-38 Lightning was the only American aircraft in production throughout the entirety of the war years. Perhaps the most legendary exploit of this twin-boom fighter was when a group of Lightnings intercepted and shot down Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto, the architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This particular variant was modified for photo reconaissance. 


The only flying P-47M Thunderbolt in the world resides in the Legends Hangar. Designed by Republic Aviation, the P-47 saw extensive service during World War II, escorting bombers and strafing ground targets.

### Starfighter Hangar

A large number of military aircraft spanning World War II to the modern day are located in this hangar. 

The P-39 was further developed into the P-63A Kingcobra. With better alternatives to choose from, the USAAF did not adopt the Kingcobra for combat and instead used them as flying targets. 

The Navy's first operational jet fighter, the FJ-1 Fury saw brief service and was retired in 1953.

A light attack jet, the A-4 Skyhawk participated in the Vietnam War, Yom Kippur War, Falklands War, and Gulf War. 

An all-weather multirole fighter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon equips the airforces of 26 nations. This aircraft bear the markings of the USAF Thunderbirds, who continue to show off the F-16's maneuverability at airshows. 

The F/A-18 Hornet is the current workhorse of the United States Navy. The Hornet is versatile with an ability to serve both fighter and attack roles. The aircraft on display features livery of the Blue Angels, the Navy's flight demonstration team.  

### Restoration Hangar

Aircraft in need of assembly and repair are placed in the restoration hangar. When I visited there were numerous restoration projects in progress. 

Replacing the SBD Dauntless, the SB2C Helldiver saw action in the later battles of the Pacific Theater and contributed to sinking the world's two largest battleships. 

### Boneyard

Aircraft in queue for restoration reside in the museum's boneyard.
