# Yanks Air Museum

Established in 1973, Yanks Air Museum focuses on preserving and restoring American aircraft. Yanks is one of two museums located on the grounds of Chino Airport (the other being Planes of Fame Air Museum.) The museum boasts a collection of nearly two hundred aircraft. 

I visited Yanks on September 22 during their Museum Day promotion. Yanks was one of many museums across the United States offering free admission through a partnership with Smithsonian Magazine. I personally enjoy aviation museums and couldn't pass on this opportunity. 

### Legends Hangar

This hangar stores numerous civilian aircraft that flew during the Golden Age of Aviation. In addition, several World War II planes are kept here.

Almost every single American and Candadian World War I pilot trained in a JN-4D Jenny. Following the war, many civilians were able to purchase surplus aircraft and use them for barnstorming. Its simplicity and availability transformed the Jenny into a classic icon of the Golden Age.

The P-38 Lightning was the only American aircraft in production throughout the entirety of the war years. Perhaps the most legendary exploit of this twin-boom fighter was when a group of Lightnings intercepted and shot down Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto, the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack. Several P-38s, like this one, was modified for photo reconaissance.

The first Mustangs were P-51As equipped with the Allison engine, which performed poorly at high altitude. Once the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was installed, the P-51 was able to escort high-flying bombers all the way to Berlin. The Mustang also saw combat in the Pacific Theater. Postwar, the planes supported UN operations in Korea and many still fly today as air racers.

The only flying P-47M Thunderbolt in the world resides in the Legends Hangar. Designed by Republic Aviation, the P-47 saw extensive service during World War II, escorting bombers and attacking ground targets. Rugged and reliable, it's no surprise that 0.7% of Thunderbolts were lost in battle.
