# Yanks Air Museum

On September 22, 2018, many museums across the United States offered free admission through a partnership with Smithsonian Magazine. Yanks Air Museum was a participating location and appealed to my interest in historical aircraft.  

## About The Museum

Yanks is located in Chino, a half-hour's drive from where I currently attend college. Established in 1973, the museum focuses on preserving and restoring American aircraft. Yanks is one of two museums located on the grounds of Chino Airport, the other being the Planes of Fame Air Museum. The museum is rather cramped with its massive collection, making it difficult to obtain the best photos.

### Legends Hangar

This hangar is home to numerous civilian aircraft which took to the skies between the Wright Brothers' first flight and World War II. A number of World War II aircraft also reside in this building.

It took about four months between design and flight for the P-51 Mustang. The first Mustangs were the P-51As equipped with the Allison engine, which performed poorly at high altitude. Once the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was installed, the P-51 was able to escort high-flying bombers all the way to Berlin. The Mustang also participated in the Pacific Theater. Postwar, the P-51 saw action in Korea and many still fly today, particularly as air racers.
