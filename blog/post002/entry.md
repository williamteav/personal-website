Months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Corps established Merced Army Air Field (later Castle Air Force Base) to train pilots. A popular training aircraft of the time was the North American AT-6 Texan. This particular aircraft was operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force prior to its acquisition by the museum.

The Vultee BT-13 Valiant was an intermediate trainer for pilots during World War II.  

Outdated at the beginning of World War II, the Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber was relegated to transport and anti-submarine duties. The aircraft on display is a B-18B with a lengthy postwar career as a crop sprayer, cargo transport, and fire tanker. 

Designed by Douglas as a successor to its B-18, the B-23 Dragon was never used in combat, passed over in favor of more advanced medium bombers. This B-23 was used during wartime to train maintenance crews. Following the war, it was an executive transport for several companies. 

A military variant of the Beechcraft Model 18, the C-45 Expeditor served as a light transport. The C-45G on display was stationed in Italy before transitioning to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture.

Throughout World War II, the North American B-25 Mitchell could be adapted for a variety of missions ranging from conventional bombing to anti-shipping patrols. Its claim to fame occurred in April 1942 when several B-25s took off from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to bomb Tokyo. The museum’s aircraft is a B-25J, the most numerous variant of the Mitchell. After the war, this B-25 was converted to an air tanker and later served as a testbed for Texas Instruments. 

A speedy ground-attack bomber, the Douglas A-26 Invader saw action in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The museum’s A-26B was delivered to the Salvadoran Air Force during the late 1970s.

Nicknamed the “Flying Fortress” due to its defensive armament and ability to take damage, the Boeing B-17 rose to fame through its daylight bombing missions against Nazi Germany. Several B-17s, such as this B-17G, saw postwar service as fire tankers.  

The most-produced heavy bomber in history, the Consolidated B-24 Liberator flew alongside B-17s over Europe. The Liberator’s superior range, however, allowed it to supplant the Flying Fortress in the Pacific Theater. Records indicate that this B-24M flew as a transport in Bolivia from 1951 to 1973.   

Featuring a pressurized cabin and computer-controlled gun turrets, the technologically advanced Boeing B-29 Superfortress provided the means for a sustained bombing campaign against the Japanese home islands. This B-29 is a composite of three separate aircraft and is also reputed to be haunted.  

Of the various transports available, only the Curtiss C-46 Commando could fly the air supply route over the Himalayas. Overshadowed by the C-47, the C-46 was criticized for its difficult maintenance and survivability issues. The C-46D on display had previously served the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. 

An icon of World War II, the Douglas C-47 Skytrain was a conversion of the popular DC-3 airliner. Many operators across the world continue to use the C-47 for both civil and military purposes. This C-47 bears alternating black and white invasion stripes to reduce friendly fire during the Normandy landings.

The United States Air Force’s first jet bomber, the North American B-45 Tornado flew reconnaissance missions during the Korean War and equipped several air wings of Strategic Air Command through the 1950s. The museum’s aircraft is one of three surviving B-45s and the only B-45A variant remaining.  

After World War II, the B-29 design incorporated engine and structural improvements, resulting in the B-50 Superfortress. The 93rd Bombardment Wing was equipped with B-50s in the early Cold War years. This aircraft is a WB-50 weather reconnaissance variant.   

A cargo variant of the B-29 Superfortress, the C-97 Stratofreighter, was further modified for aerial refueling, resulting in the KC-97 Stratofreighter. Several KC-97s were outfitted with jet engines to better match the speed of other jet aircraft during refueling operations. 

Related to the Boeing 707, the KC-135 Stratotanker succeeded the KC-97 in the aerial refueling role. The Stratotanker remains in service with the United States Air Force.

With the longest wingspan of any combat aircraft ever built, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker is also the largest piston aircraft to enter mass production. Designed during World War II, the B-36 would provide the United States with the capability of striking Nazi Germany from bases in North America. While the aircraft did not enter service until after World War II, the Peacemaker remained an integral piece of Strategic Air Command’s deterrence force during the early Cold War. The aircraft on display is a reconnaissance RB-36H.

The Boeing B-47 Stratojet, with its six turbojets and swept wing, represented the latest advances in postwar technological advances. Prior to the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, aircraft such as the B-47 provided nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union. The museum’s B-47E was the last of its kind to fly.  

Having equipped the bomber wings of the United States Air Force since 1955, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is expected to remain in service for many years to come. This B-52D participated during the Vietnam War and sports wartime camouflage.

Designed to fly faster and higher than existing Soviet interceptors, the Convair B-58 holds the distinction of being the world’s first operational supersonic bomber. The B-58’s career was cut short by the introduction of Soviet surface-to-air missiles.

The United States’ first jet fighter, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star arrived in Europe in the waning moments of World War II but did not see combat. A few years later, however, the F-80 would clash against Soviet-built MiG-15s over Korea. 

Intended to defend against incoming Soviet bombers, the Lockheed F-94 was one of the first jet fighters to be equipped with radar. During the Korean War, F-94s operating at night downed several hostile aircraft.  

When it entered service in 1947, the Republic F-84 Thunderjet was the first United States Air Force fighter jet capable of carrying nuclear weapons. During the Korean War, the Thunderjet was outclassed by the MiG-15 but excelled in the ground-attack role. 

An evolution of the Thunderjet, the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak lacked the performance of contemporary swept-wing fighters but found its niche as a ground-attack platform. During the Cold War, NATO Thunderstreaks were armed and ready to execute tactical nuclear strikes against the Warsaw Pact.

Later variants of the North American F-86 Sabre incorporated radar and a heavier assortment of weaponry. Known as the “Sabre Dog,” these F-86s were tasked with intercepting enemy aircraft and carried either cannons or rockets.

Patrolling the arctic skies, the Northrop F-89 Scorpion was sluggish but heavily armed. Later variants of the Scorpion were armed with wingtip rockets and Genie air-to-air nuclear missiles. 

Designed as an escort fighter, the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo was instead used as a nuclear strike fighter, interceptor, and photoreconnaissance aircraft. A difficult aircraft to fly, the Voodoo nevertheless broke multiple speed records, earning the nickname “One-Oh-Wonder.”

The lightweight, supersonic Lockheed F-104 Starfighter was not agile enough for dogfighting but found roles in ground attack, interception, and photoreconnaissance. Many NATO members operated the Starfighter, with several flying until the twenty-first century. 

An all-weather interceptor, the Convair F-106 Delta Dart defended the skies of North America against potential Soviet bombing raids. Its avionics were linked with ground systems, allowing the Delta Dart to seamlessly detect and acquire targets.

The carrier-based North American A-5 Vigilante was designed to execute nuclear strikes at twice the speed of sound. While advanced for its time, the introduction of submarine-based nuclear missiles brought an early end to the A-5’s career as a bomber. Afterwards, most Vigilantes (such as this one) were converted into RA-5C reconnaissance aircraft.

<center><img src="HU16.JPG"></center>

The Grumman HU-16 Albatross flying boat mainly flew search and rescue missions. Some were modified for antisubmarine warfare.

Known as the Tweet for the noise emitted by its engines, the Cessna T-37 is a trainer that was subsequently developed into the A-37 Dragonfly ground attack aircraft. 

<center><img src="VULCAN.JPG"></center>

An airshow favorite due to the distinctive howl of its four Olympus engines, the Avro Vulcan was one of three British “V bombers” in service during the Cold War. Despite its massive size, the Vulcan’s delta wing provided remarkable high-altitude maneuverability. 

<center><img src="CANUCK.JPG"></center>

Canada’s first supersonic fighter, the Avro-Canada CF-100 Canuck flew air defense missions during the early Cold War years.  

The successor to the MiG-15, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 offered significant improvements in high-speed stability. Assigned the reporting name “Fresco” by NATO intelligence, the MiG-17 was widely exported and saw action across the globe. 

Small, agile, and fast, the delta-winged Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 remains the world’s most produced fighter aircraft. Like the MiG-17, the MiG-21 “Fishbed” was widely exported and flown in numerous Cold War conflicts. 

<center><img src="DRAKEN.JPG"></center>

With its unique double-delta wing, the SAAB J35 Draken was one of Sweden’s premier Cold War fighters and fulfilled the air defense role for many European air forces. Through its advanced fire control and weaponry systems, the Draken remained formidable throughout the latter half of the twentieth century.
