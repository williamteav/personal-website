# Castle Air Museum

<center><img src="CASTLE2.JPG"></center>

Castle Air Museum is located in Atwater, a small town in Central California. The museum resides near Castle Airport, which operated as Castle Air Force Base during the Cold War and was home to the 93rd Bombardment Wing of Strategic Air Command. Its collection numbers over seventy historical military aircraft, the majority of which are displayed outdoors.   

I visited the museum during their Fall 2019 Open Cockpit Day, when several aircraft are opened for visitors to explore.

Castle Air Force Base was established in 1941 as the Army Air Corps Basic Flying School. Pilots would learn to fly through a series of training aircraft, one of which was the **North American T-6 Texan**. This particular aircraft was operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force prior to its acquisition by the museum.  

<center><img src="BT13.JPG"></center>

The **Vultee BT-13 Valiant** was an intermediate trainer for pilots during World War II. Pilots would fly the Valiant before progressing to the Texan.   

<center><img src="B18.JPG"></center>

A prewar development of the DC-2 airliner, the **Douglas B-18 Bolo** medium bomber was obsolete by the time World War II broke out. Nevertheless the Bolo contributed to the sinking of several German submarines off the Atlantic coast. The B-18B on display was modified for anti-submarine patrols and later served as a crop sprayer, cargo transport, and fire tanker.

Designed as a successor to the B-18, the **Douglas B-23 Dragon** never saw combat during World War II, having been passed over in favor of more advanced medium bombers. Several Dragons, such this one, were converted to UC-67 executive transports. 

<center><img src="C45.JPG"></center>

The **C-45 Expeditor** is a military variant of the Beechcraft Model 18. Expeditors were used to train aircrew, conduct reconnaissance, and transport light cargo. 

<center><img src="B25.JPG"></center>

Throughout World War II, the versatile **North American B-25 Mitchell** proved capable of a variety of missions ranging from ground attack to anti-shipping. The museum’s aircraft is a B-25J, the final and most numerous version of the Mitchell. 

<center><img src="A26.JPG"></center>

A speedy ground-attack bomber, the **Douglas A-26 Invader** saw action in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. The museum’s A-26 served in the Salvadoran Air Force from 1969 to 1974. 

<center><img src="B17.JPG"></center>

The **Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress** earned its nickname from its extensive defensive armament and ability to sustain damage. The Flying Fortress on display is a B-17G, which incorporated the iconic Bendix chin turret.   

<center><img src="B24.JPG"></center>

The most-produced heavy bomber in history, the **Consolidated B-24 Liberator** flew alongside B-17s over Europe. The B-24's superior range allowed it to supplant the Flying Fortress in the Atlantic and Pacific Theaters.    

<center><img src="B29.JPG"></center>

The **Boeing B-29 Superfortress**, featuring a pressurized cabin and computer-controlled gun turrets, was a state-of-the-art aircraft when it first flew in 1942. B-29s carried out bombing missions during World War II and Korea. This Superfortress is a composite of three separate aircraft and is rumored to be haunted by unidentified spirits.   

<center><img src="C46.JPG"></center>

Of the various transports available during World War II, only the Curtiss C-46 Commando could maintain the air supply route over the Himalayas. Despite its critical wartime role, the Commando was overshadowed by the C-47 Skytrain due to perceptions of inferior maintainability and survivability. The C-46D on display had previously served the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. 

<center><img src="C47.JPG"></center>

An icon of World War II, the Douglas C-47 Skytrain was a conversion of the popular DC-3 airliner. Many operators across the world continue to use the C-47 for both civil and military purposes. This C-47 bears alternating black and white invasion stripes to reduce friendly fire during the Normandy landings.  

<center><img src="C56.JPG"></center>

Derived from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, the C-56 was used as a personnel transport. This example was acquired during World War II by the South African Air Force and converted into a bomber. 

<center><img src="C54.JPG"></center>

A military conversion of the Douglas DC-4 airliner, the C-54 Skymaster was the first aircraft to bear the designation “Air Force One.” 

<center><img src="B45.JPG"></center>

The United States Air Force’s first jet bomber, the North American B-45 Tornado flew reconnaissance missions during the Korean War and equipped several air wings of Strategic Air Command through the 1950s. The museum’s aircraft is one of three surviving B-45s and the only B-45A variant remaining.  

<center><img src="B50.JPG"></center>

After World War II, the B-29 design incorporated engine and structural improvements, resulting in the B-50 Superfortress. The 93rd Bombardment Wing was equipped with B-50s in the early Cold War years. This aircraft is a WB-50 weather reconnaissance variant.   

<center><img src="C97.JPG"></center>

A cargo variant of the B-29 Superfortress, the C-97 Stratofreighter, was further modified for aerial refueling, resulting in the KC-97 Stratofreighter. Several KC-97s were outfitted with jet engines to better match the speed of other jet aircraft during refueling operations. 

<center><img src="KC135.JPG"></center>

Related to the Boeing 707, the KC-135 Stratotanker succeeded the KC-97 in the aerial refueling role. The Stratotanker remains in service with the United States Air Force.

<center><img src="B36.JPG"></center>

With the longest wingspan of any combat aircraft ever built, the Convair B-36 Peacemaker is also the largest piston aircraft to enter mass production. Designed during World War II, the B-36 would provide the United States with the capability of striking Nazi Germany from bases in North America. While the aircraft did not enter service until after World War II, the Peacemaker remained an integral piece of Strategic Air Command’s deterrence force during the early Cold War. The aircraft on display is a reconnaissance RB-36H.

<center><img src="B47.JPG"></center>

The Boeing B-47 Stratojet, with its six turbojets and swept wing, represented the latest advances in postwar technological advances. Prior to the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, aircraft such as the B-47 provided nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union. The museum’s B-47E was the last of its kind to fly.  

<center><img src="B52.JPG"></center>

Having equipped the bomber wings of the United States Air Force since 1955, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is expected to remain in service for many years to come. This B-52D participated during the Vietnam War and sports wartime camouflage. 

<center><img src="B58.JPG"></center>

Designed to fly faster and higher than existing Soviet interceptors, the Convair B-58 holds the distinction of being the world’s first operational supersonic bomber. The B-58’s career was cut short by the introduction of Soviet surface-to-air missiles.

<center><img src="P80.JPG"></center>

The United States’ first jet fighter, the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star arrived in Europe in the waning moments of World War II but did not see combat. A few years later, however, the F-80 would clash against Soviet-built MiG-15s over Korea. 

<center><img src="F94.JPG"></center>

Intended to defend against incoming Soviet bombers, the Lockheed F-94 was one of the first jet fighters to be equipped with radar. During the Korean War, F-94s operating at night downed several hostile aircraft.  

<center><img src="F84.JPG"></center>

When it entered service in 1947, the Republic F-84 Thunderjet was the first United States Air Force fighter jet capable of carrying nuclear weapons. During the Korean War, the Thunderjet was outclassed by the MiG-15 but excelled in the ground-attack role. 

<center><img src="F84F.JPG"></center>

An evolution of the Thunderjet, the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak lacked the performance of contemporary swept-wing fighters but found its niche as a ground-attack platform. During the Cold War, NATO Thunderstreaks were armed and ready to execute tactical nuclear strikes against the Warsaw Pact.

<center><img src="F86.JPG"></center>

Later variants of the North American F-86 Sabre incorporated radar and a heavier assortment of weaponry. Known as the “Sabre Dog,” these F-86s were tasked with intercepting enemy aircraft and carried either cannons or rockets.

<center><img src="F89.JPG"></center>

Patrolling the arctic skies, the Northrop F-89 Scorpion was sluggish but heavily armed. Later variants of the Scorpion were armed with wingtip rockets and Genie air-to-air nuclear missiles. 

<center><img src="F101.JPG"></center>

Designed as an escort fighter, the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo was instead used as a nuclear strike fighter, interceptor, and photoreconnaissance aircraft. A difficult aircraft to fly, the Voodoo nevertheless broke multiple speed records, earning the nickname “One-Oh-Wonder.”

<center><img src="F104.JPG"></center>

The lightweight, supersonic Lockheed F-104 Starfighter was not agile enough for dogfighting but found roles in ground attack, interception, and photoreconnaissance. Many NATO members operated the Starfighter, with several flying until the twenty-first century. 

<center><img src="F106.JPG"></center>

An all-weather interceptor, the Convair F-106 Delta Dart defended the skies of North America against potential Soviet bombing raids. Its avionics were linked with ground systems, allowing the Delta Dart to seamlessly detect and acquire targets. 

<center><img src="F4.JPG"></center>

Taking to the skies for the first time in 1958, the McDonnell F-4 Phantom was a large but powerful fighter aircraft. An icon of the Cold War, the Phantom was deployed by many foreign air forces, several of which continue to operate the aircraft. The jet on display is a F-4E painted in Thunderbirds livery. 

<center><img src="F8.JPG"></center>

The first carrier-based fighter to break the sound barrier, the Vought F-8 Crusader featured a unique variable-incidence wing which allowed for lower landing speeds.

<center><img src="A4.JPG"></center>

A light attack aircraft, the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk was small enough to fit aboard carriers without the need for folding wings. The aircraft on display is an A-4L.

<center><img src="A3.JPG"></center>

The first aircraft to drop bombs on North Vietnam, the Douglas A-3 Skywarrior was designed to give aircraft carriers a means to deliver nuclear ordinance. Several aircraft were converted for electronic warfare and tanker duties. The Skywarrior, also known as the “Whale,” remains the largest aircraft to ever operate from a carrier. 

<center><img src="A5.JPG"></center>

The carrier-based North American A-5 Vigilante was designed to execute nuclear strikes at twice the speed of sound. While advanced for its time, the introduction of submarine-based nuclear missiles brought an early end to the A-5’s career as a bomber. Afterwards, most Vigilantes (such as this one) were converted into RA-5C reconnaissance aircraft. 

<center><img src="B57.JPG"></center>
