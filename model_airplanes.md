## Model Airplanes

![F-15](IMG_1360.JPG) 
I began building model aircraft during my freshman year of high school. My first model was a Revell SnapTite Harrier GR7. That kit was prepainted and required simple assembly. I then moved on to models that required painting and gluing. Initially I stuck to 1/72 scale World War II aircraft. Eventually I worked on different scales and aircraft types. 

I see myself as a fairly casual builder. I prefer simple builds that can be done over a weekend. I also paint my models entirely by hand using cheap acrylic paints from Michaels.
