I began building model aircraft during my freshman year of high school. My first model was a Revell SnapTite Harrier GR7. That kit was prepainted and required simple assembly. I then moved on to models that required painting and gluing. Initially I built only 1/72 scale World War II aircraft. Soon I built kits of aircraft in different scales and from other time periods. 

## Kits Built

* Dassault Mirage III
* Douglas SBD-3 Dauntless
* Hawker Sea Hawk FGA.6
* Ilyushin Il-28
* Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden-Kai
* Kawasaki Ki-61 Hien 
* McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle
* Messerchmitt Bf 109 E-3
* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15
* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19
* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21
* Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25
* Nakajima B5N2
* Nakajima Ki-43-II Hayabusa
* North American F-86F-30 Sabre 
* Supermarine Spitfire Mk 1

Current Project: Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut

My goal is to eventually dedicate a page to each completed model. Meanwhile images of my models can be found on my Facebook.
