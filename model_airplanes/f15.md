## The Plane
The F-15 Eagle is a air superiority fighter capable of exceeding Mach 2.5. The F-15 entered service in 1976 and is expected to remain in the USAF inventory for several more decades. Foreign operators of the Eagle include Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. F-15 pilots have scored over 100 kills against zero losses.

I purchased this kit at a Taiwan hobby shop for $3 USD. The manufacturer of this kit is Mini Hobby Models but the mold was created by Crown in 1975. The kit does not include an interior.
