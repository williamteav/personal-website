The Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa (Peregrine Falcon) equipped the air forces of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Like the A6M Zero, the Hayabusa sacrificed armor protection for maneuverability. Entering service in 1941, the Hayabusa would become a frequent sight in the China-Burma-India Theater. Early Ki-43s were armed with 7.7mm machine guns and later variants were upgraded with 12.7mm machine guns. While a potent opponent at the beginning of the war, the Ki-43 became outdated was many were expended in kamikaze attacks. The Hayabusa was given the Allied reporting name "Oscar." 

A mid-war upgrade, the Ki-43-II introduced a three-bladed propeller and an upgraded engine. Its wing structure was also strengthened and fitted with racks for either drop tanks or light bombs. Armor protection was added to the cockpit and fuel tank areas.    

## The Kit
The 1/72 scale model kit is manufactured by Hasegawa. Its low part count and simple assembly makes it an ideal kit for beginners.
