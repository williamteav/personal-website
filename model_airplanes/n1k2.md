## The Plane

The story of the N1K2-J began with the N1K1 Kyofu. A floatplane fighter, the N1K1 possessed remarkable speed and maneuverability. However, it was designed to support offensive operations.

A land-based variant of the N1K1, the N1K1-J, took flight in late 1942. It was a promising design but suffered from problems with its engine and landing gear.

The N1K1-J was further refined to the N1K2-J. A notable difference was that the wing was mounted lower on the N1K2-J, allowing for shorter landing gear. The N1K2-J was an excellent fighter capable of taking on the latest Allied types. However, it lacked the high-altitude performance to intercept B-29s. 

## The Kit

I purchased this kit at a Taiwan hobby shop for $3 USD. The manufacturer of this kit is Mini Hobby Models but the mold was created by Crown in 1975. The kit includes neither an interior nor wing hardpoints. 

## The Build

Assembly was simple and all pieces fit together snugly. The aircraft's markings indicated it belonged the 18th Wing of the USAF, stationed in Okinawa.
