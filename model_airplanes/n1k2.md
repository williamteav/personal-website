## The Kit

I purchased this kit at a Taiwan hobby shop for $3 USD. The manufacturer of this kit is Mini Hobby Models but the mold was created by Crown in 1975. The kit includes neither an interior nor wing hardpoints. 

## The Build

Assembly was simple and all pieces fit together snugly. The aircraft's markings indicated it belonged the 18th Wing of the USAF, stationed in Okinawa.
