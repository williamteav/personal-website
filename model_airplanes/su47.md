## The Plane
The Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut first flew in 1997 as a technology demonstrator. It featured forward-swept wings which provided excellent maneuverability. Only one aircraft was produced.

The Su-47 that I'm building is a 1/144 scale kit by Trumpeter. It consists of 57 parts spread across four sprues. The parts contain minimal flash and are easy to detach.
