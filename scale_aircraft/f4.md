## The Plane
A symbol of Western airpower during the Cold War, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was widely exported and participated in numerous regional conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. 

A heavy two-seat, twin-engine interceptor, the Phantom was capable of Mach 2 flight and set several speed records. 

The F-4 was the primary fighter aircraft deployed by the United States in the Vietnam War. Designed to shoot down lumbering bombers, the Phantom instead battled lighter, more agile MiG-17s and MiG-21s of the Vietnamese People's Air Force. Initially armed with only air-to-air missiles which tended to misfire, later variants of the F-4 were equipped with the M61 Vulcan cannon. 

The F-4E was the most numerous variant of the Phantom and the first to carry internal armament. 

Although the United States retired the F-4 in the late 1990s, they remain in service today with several nations. 

## The Kit

Although it came in a MiniHobbyModels box, the kit made its debut in 1984 as part of Academy's Warplanes of the World line.
